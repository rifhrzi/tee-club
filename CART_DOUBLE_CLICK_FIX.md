# Cart Page Double-Click Fix

## Problem
Users needed to click the "Lanjut ke Pembayaran" (Proceed to Checkout) button twice for it to work properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `DirectLoginLink` component that wraps the checkout button. Similar to the previous product page issue, the problem was caused by:

1. **Authentication state timing**: Session status was "loading" when button was first clicked
2. **Loading state interference**: Component was showing loading state instead of allowing clicks
3. **Event handler conflicts**: Click handlers not working properly on first click due to session loading

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced DirectLoginLink Click Handlers**
```javascript
// Added session loading checks for authenticated users
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Don't proceed if session is still loading
  if (status === 'loading') {
    console.log('DirectLoginLink: Session still loading, please wait...');
    return;
  }
  
  router.push(href);
};
```

### 2. **Enhanced Unauthenticated User Handler**
```javascript
// Added session loading checks for unauthenticated users
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Don't proceed if session is still loading
  if (status === 'loading') {
    console.log('DirectLoginLink: Session still loading, please wait...');
    return;
  }
  
  // Existing logic...
}}
```

### 3. **Improved Loading State Display**
```javascript
// Better loading state with disabled button
if (status === 'loading' || isRedirecting) {
  return (
    <span className={`${className} opacity-70 cursor-wait`}>
      {React.cloneElement(children as React.ReactElement, {
        disabled: true,
        children: status === 'loading' ? 'Checking auth...' : 'Redirecting...'
      })}
    </span>
  );
}
```

### 4. **Removed Global Loading Interference**
- Removed automatic global loading triggers from cart page authentication useEffect
- Only trigger loading for actual redirects, not status checks

## Files Modified

1. **`components/DirectLoginLink.tsx`**
   - Added session loading checks in both authenticated and unauthenticated click handlers
   - Improved loading state display with disabled button
   - Enhanced debugging logs

2. **`app/cart/page.tsx`**
   - Removed global loading interference from authentication useEffect
   - Cleaned up unused imports

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Single Click Should Work**
- First click on "Lanjut ke Pembayaran" → Navigate to checkout immediately
- No need for second click

### ✅ **Loading States**
- Button shows "Checking auth..." when session is loading
- Button is disabled (not clickable) during loading
- Clear visual feedback about authentication status

### ✅ **Authentication Flow**
- **Authenticated users**: Immediate navigation to checkout
- **Unauthenticated users**: Immediate redirect to login with checkout redirect
- **Loading users**: Button disabled until session resolves

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Test Single Click Functionality (Authenticated Users)**
1. Login to your account
2. Add some products to cart
3. Go to cart page
4. Click "Lanjut ke Pembayaran" **once** → Should navigate to checkout immediately

### 2. **Test Single Click Functionality (Unauthenticated Users)**
1. Logout from your account
2. Add some products to cart (if possible)
3. Go to cart page
4. Click "Lanjut ke Pembayaran" **once** → Should redirect to login immediately

### 3. **Test Loading States**
1. Refresh the cart page
2. Immediately try clicking the checkout button → Should be disabled with "Checking auth..." text
3. Wait for authentication to load → Button should become enabled

## Console Logs to Verify Fix

### ✅ **Successful Single Click (Authenticated):**
```
DirectLoginLink: User is authenticated, navigating to: /checkout
DirectLoginLink: Authentication state at click: {status: "authenticated", isAuthenticated: true, sessionExists: true}
```

### ✅ **Successful Single Click (Unauthenticated):**
```
DirectLoginLink: Unauthenticated click handler called
DirectLoginLink: Authentication state at click: {status: "unauthenticated", isAuthenticated: false, sessionExists: false}
DirectLoginLink: User not authenticated, redirecting to login
```

### ❌ **If Still Double-Clicking (shouldn't happen):**
```
DirectLoginLink: Session still loading, please wait...
[Second click]
DirectLoginLink: User is authenticated, navigating to: /checkout
```

## Verification

The double-click issue on the cart page should now be completely resolved. Users should be able to:
- ✅ Proceed to checkout with a single click (authenticated users)
- ✅ Get redirected to login with a single click (unauthenticated users)
- ✅ See appropriate loading states during authentication checks
- ✅ Experience smooth checkout flow
