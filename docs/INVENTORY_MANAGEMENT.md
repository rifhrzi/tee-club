#### StockHistory
```prisma
model StockHistory {
  id          String      @id @default(uuid())
  productId   String?
  product     Product?    @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
  variantId   String?
  variant     Variant?    @relation(fields: [variantId], references: [id])
  type        StockChangeType
  quantity    Int         // Positive for increase, negative for decrease
  previousStock Int
  newStock    Int
  reason      String      // e.g., "Order payment", "Admin adjustment", "Refund"
  orderId     String?     // Reference to order if stock change is due to order
  userId      String?     // User who made the change (for admin adjustments)
  user        User?       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())

  @@index([productId])
  @@index([variantId])
  @@index([orderId])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@index([type])
}

enum StockChangeType {
  PURCHASE      // Stock reduced due to purchase
  REFUND        // Stock increased due to refund
  ADJUSTMENT    // Manual admin adjustment
  RESTOCK       // Stock replenishment
  DAMAGE        // Stock reduced due to damage/loss
}
```

#### Enhanced Product & Variant Models
- Added `stockHistory` relations
- Added database indexes for performance
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Core Services

### 1. Inventory Service (`lib/services/inventory.ts`)

#### Key Functions:
- `validateStockAvailability()` - Validates stock for multiple items
- `reduceStockWithHistory()` - Atomically reduces stock with audit trail
- `increaseStockWithHistory()` - Atomically increases stock with audit trail
- `processOrderStockChanges()` - Processes stock changes for entire orders
- `getCurrentStock()` - Gets current stock level
- `getStockStatus()` - Returns stock status for display

#### Example Usage:
```typescript
// Validate stock before checkout
const validation = await validateStockAvailability([
  { productId: 'prod-1', quantity: 2 },
  { productId: 'prod-2', variantId: 'var-1', quantity: 1 }
]);

// Reduce stock with history
const result = await reduceStockWithHistory(
  'product-id',
  5,
  'variant-id',
  {
    orderId: 'order-123',
    reason: 'Order payment confirmed',
    type: 'PURCHASE'
  }
);
```

### 2. Order Processing Service (`lib/services/orderProcessing.ts`)

#### Key Functions:
- `processOrderPayment()` - Handles payment confirmation and stock reduction
- `processOrderRefund()` - Handles refunds and stock restoration
- `validateCartStock()` - Validates cart items before checkout
- `handleOrderStatusChange()` - Manages order status transitions with stock changes

#### Integration Points:
- Payment notification webhooks
- Admin order management
- Refund processing
- Checkout validation

## Frontend Components

### 1. Stock Status Components (`components/product/StockStatus.tsx`)

#### Components:
- `StockStatus` - Main stock status display with icons and colors
- `StockBadge` - Compact badge for product cards
- `StockProgressBar` - Visual stock level indicator
- `StockAlert` - Low stock warning component
- `QuantitySelector` - Stock-aware quantity selector

#### Features:
- Responsive design with multiple sizes
- Color-coded status indicators
- Accessibility support
- Smooth animations

### 2. Admin Inventory Management
