// Legacy authentication types - kept for reference but not used with NextAuth.js
// NextAuth.js uses its own type definitions in app/next-auth.d.ts

// Note: These types are no longer used in the application.
// The application now uses NextAuth.js built-in types:
// - Session from 'next-auth'
// - User from 'next-auth' (extended in app/next-auth.d.ts)
// - JWT from 'next-auth/jwt' (extended in app/next-auth.d.ts)

// This file can be safely removed in the future if no legacy code references these types.
